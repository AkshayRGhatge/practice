Event Async code
Java script  
    1. Synchronous: single code execution at a time
    2. Single threaded

Execution Context
    execute one line of code at a time

Two type of code written in java script
    1. Blocking code (Read file sync)

        * Blocking code will wait on another program to finish
        * Block the flow of the program
        * Example kernel in OS

    2. Non Blocking code  (Read file async )

        * Non Blocking code does not wait for another program to finish
        * Does not block execution
        * Not good when the Registration procedure is going on file is storing in the database 
        and give the message 'Registration sucessfully'
