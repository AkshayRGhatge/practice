-----JavaScript Execution context----

Javascript is a single thread execution


1. Global Execution context
2. Function Execution context
3. Eval Execution context 


Browser do have different GLobal Execution context than node


When java script code run 
Step#1 Global Execution context  (this keyword)
Step#2 Creation Phase/ Memory Execution
Step#3 Execution Phase or Context 


Memory Execution phase in which all the variables get stored value set as undefined note about function name it stores value as defination

In Execution phase whenever the function is execute it will create another environment and execution  thread for the function

1.JS creates Global excution context 
2.Next it creates memory phase
3.Memory phase - In this phase,the variables are set to undefined 
  until the execution phase(next phase) and the functions are set to their definitions.
4.Next it creates the execution phase
5.Execution phase - In this phase,the variables are initialsed to given values and 
  when the function s are called,it creates a memory phase and execution phase for the function 
  just like the main one.

For live demo:
browser > inspect > Sources
create a snippet with few functions and visually experience the call stack follow lifo

Return value is passed to global environment
Execution context get deleted as well
